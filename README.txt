ocaml-latexmarkup - A library handling latex markup style text.
===============================================================

Nowadays most of the websites allowing their users to post content (articles,
comments, etc.) allows the writers to format their interventions in some way.
Usually through BBcode or markdown. This library proposes to use the LaTeX
syntax to achieve this goal. The advantages are multiple. First of all LaTeX
is a well established language; either the user already knows it, either he
wins something more than being able to post on a website by learning it. 
Second the content can easily be converted into true LaTeX by providing a
good header. Third the syntax is very easy to learn as there are only four
constructs, namely commands, environments and math expressions (inlined or in
display-mode).

See the file [INSTALL.txt](INSTALL.txt) for building and installation
instructions.
