Description: Nowadays most of the websites allowing their users to post content
  (articles, comments, etc.) allows the writers to format their interventions
  in some way. Usually through BBcode or markdown. This library proposes to use
  the LaTeX syntax to achieve this goal. The advantages are multiple. First of
  all LaTeX is a well established language; either the user already knows it,
  either he wins something more than being able to post on a website by
  learning it.  Second the content can easily be converted into true LaTeX by
  providing a good header. Third the syntax is very easy to learn as there are
  only four constructs, namely commands, environments and math expressions
  (inlined or in display-mode).
